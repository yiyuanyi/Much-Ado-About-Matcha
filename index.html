            <h2 class="matcha-header">Types of Matcha</h2>
            <p>There are many different types of matcha, varying from cooking grade, all the way up to ceremonial grade which can cost $100 for 100g of powder.</p>
            <h2 class="grades-header">Grades of Matcha</h2>
            <h3 class="cooking">Cooking Grade</h3>
            <p>Cooking/culinary grade matcha is the cheapest of all the grades. It is mainly used for cooking purposes and has a slightly bitter taste due to various factors involved in the production and manufacture of the product.</p>
            <h3 class="premium">Premium Grade</h3>
            <p>Premium grade matcha is high-quality matcha made from tea leaves found at the top of the tea plant. It contains the typical range of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals associated with matcha tea. It has a fresh, subtle flavour, making it a delicious daily treat.</p>
            <h3 class="ceremonial">Ceremonial Grade</h3>
            <p>Ceremonial grade matcha is the most expensive grade of matcha. It is a quality sufficient to use in tea ceremonies and Buddhist temples. It is usually ground into a powder using granite stone mills. There is no clear difference between the taste of ceremonial and premium grade matcha, but ceremonial grade matcha must be able to make koicha: a thick tea with a high proportion of powder to water, the type of tea used in the tea ceremony.</p>
